    <p> <span style="margin-left: 50px">Have</span> you ever wondered if you can do more to bring about change?  Have you wondered what you can do other than cast your single, solitary, vote at the ballot box?  Do you feel adrift and like your voice is not heard?  Well, you are certainly not alone in your morbid musings.  Many of us feel bereft of time, direction, and means to more fully involve ourselves in the political process.  </p>
     
    <p>This is where we come in: Phonebanq streamlines, organizes, and generates a daily task list to involve yourself politically.  We remove the hassle and haze of political involvement. Phonebanq is oriented towards getting citizens to contact their Senators and Representatives about issues that matter to them in a time manageable and effective way.  Just make a phone call! </p>
     
    <p>What? You think phone calls are ineffective? Guess again! <a href="http://www.attn.com/stories/12768/former-congressional-staffer-explains-how-to-make-congressman-listen"> CLICK HERE</a> to read a congressional staffer's explanation of why your calls matter.  TLDR?  They don't pay attention to facebook, twitter, or online petitions, but they do pay attention to their phones. </p>
     
    <p>Trump is not simply the opposition; he is an existential threat to progressive liberal values and policies. It is time to leave our social media bubbles, senselessly preaching to the choir or battling inflexible internet trolls with our posts.  We can speak directly to those who actually shape policies.  Grab your phone, follow our process, and finally take meaningful action. </p>

    <p>...So the answer is yes. You are now able to be an effective armchair protester. #America. </p>
