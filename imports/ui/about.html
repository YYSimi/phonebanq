    <p> Have you ever wondered if you can do more to bring about change?  Have you wondered what you can do other than cast your single, solitary, vote at the ballot box?  Do you deplore the demagogue that will soon sit in the Oval Office?  Do you feel adrift and like your voice is not heard?  On November 9, 2016, we certainly did.  Many of us feel bereft of time, direction, and a means to more fully involve ourselves in the political process.  </p>
     
    <p>This is where we come in: Phonebanq streamlines, organizes, and generates a daily task list to involve yourself politically.  We remove the hassle and haze of political involvement. Phonebanq is oriented towards getting citizens to contact their Senators and Representatives about issues that matter to them in a time manageable and effective way.  Just make a phone call! </p>
     
    <p>What? You think phone calls are ineffective? Guess again! <a href="http://www.attn.com/stories/12768/former-congressional-staffer-explains-how-to-make-congressman-listen"> Read this congressional staffer's explanation</a> of why your calls matter.  Politicians do not pay attention to facebook, twitter, or online petitions, but they do pay attention to their phones. </p>
     
    <p> The reality is that we have a loud-mouthed misogynist and aspiring tyrant as our president elect.  We cannot sit idly by while he ravages our democracy. Trump is not simply the opposition; he is an existential threat to progressive liberal values and policies.  We must stand for democracy and not the hypocrisy embodied by Trump.  It is time to leave our social media bubbles, senselessly preaching to the choir or battling irreverent and inflexible internet trolls with our posts.  We can and must speak directly to those who actually shape policies.  Grab your phone, follow our process, and finally take meaningful action. </p>

    <p>...So the answer is yes: you are now able to be an effective armchair protester.  #America</p>
