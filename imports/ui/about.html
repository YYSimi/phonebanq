    <p> {{> appName}} is a left-leaning civic engagement platform.  We streamline the process of finding meaningful civic action.  Right now, that means we're making it easy to contact your senators and representatives, but there will be more down the road </p>
    <p> The site is currently a work-in-progress ("alpha testing", for all you software nerds out there), and our goals are evolving.  We'll update this page as our ideas solidify.  In the mean time, if you have suggestions, we'd love to hear feedback.  Contact us!  If you managed to find this website, you already know who "we" are ;-).</p>
